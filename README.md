I read a blog written by CÃ‰SAR A. HIDALGO, a professor at MIT. The artcile is about how and why his team used Wikileak data to visualize
the content of Hilary Clinton's emails. Some of professor's previous projects were mentioned in the article. And I traced them to find 
the following data sources:

1. Data USA

https://datausa.io/

 - It provides stats on every aspects of the city - demography, economy, education, healthcare, transportation, etc. 
 - It is a good tool for assessing how practical it is to move to that city, or what is your social ranking in the city you live in.
 
 
2. Data Viva

http://dataviva.info/en/

 - This is the Brazilian version of Data USA I guess? - Haven't checked it out in details.
 

3. The Observatory of Economic Complexity

http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/

 - This site is amazing. It composes trade data searcheable based on country, product (refined petroleum, crude petroleum, pretroleum gas, etc).
